# Car Insurance Claim Prediction  
The project showcases the analysis of the "Car Insurance Claim" dataset and the development of a predictive model aimed to predict whether a customer is likely to file a car insurance claim (1) or not (0).  
  
  The repository includes the following files:

  - Car_Insurance_Claim.csv: the original dataset used for the analysis
  - main.ipynb: the notebook where the analysis is performed
  - Report.pdf: the final report which summaries the results
